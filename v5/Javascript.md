ðŸŒ± Basic Level:

    What is hoisting in JavaScript?
        Description: Hoisting is JavaScript's default behavior of moving declarations (variables and functions) to the top of their scope before code execution.
        Example:

    console.log(a); // undefined
    var a = 5;

    Source: Most Asked JavaScript Interview Questions â€” Part 1

Explain the difference between let, var, and const.

    Description: var is function-scoped and can be redeclared; let and const are block-scoped. const is used for variables that should not be reassigned.
    Example:

    var x = 10;
    let y = 20;
    const z = 30;
    x = 15;  // valid
    y = 25;  // valid
    z = 35;  // error

    Source: Most Asked JavaScript Interview Questions â€” Part 1

What are arrow functions, and how do they differ from regular functions?

    Description: Arrow functions have a shorter syntax and do not have their own this, arguments, or new binding.
    Example:

    const regularFunction = function() {
      return "Hello";
    };
    const arrowFunction = () => "Hello";

    Source: Most Asked JavaScript Interview Questions â€” Part 1

What is a closure in JavaScript?

    Description: A closure is a function that retains access to its lexical scope even when the function is executed outside that scope.
    Example:

    function outer() {
      let count = 0;
      return function inner() {
        count++;
        return count;
      };
    }
    const counter = outer();
    console.log(counter()); // 1
    console.log(counter()); // 2

    Source: Most Asked JavaScript Interview Questions â€” Part 1

What is the this keyword in JavaScript?

    Description: this refers to the context in which a function is executed, often the object calling the function.
    Example:

        const obj = {
          name: "Alice",
          greet: function() {
            console.log(this.name);
          }
        };
        obj.greet(); // Alice

ðŸ”¥ Medium Level:

    What is event delegation in JavaScript?
        Description: Event delegation allows attaching a single event listener to a parent element to manage events from its children.
        Example:

    document.getElementById('parent').addEventListener('click', function(event) {
      if (event.target && event.target.nodeName === 'BUTTON') {
        console.log("Button clicked", event.target.textContent);
      }
    });

    Source: Most Asked JavaScript Interview Questions â€” Part 1

Explain the difference between == and === in JavaScript.

    Description: == checks for value equality after type coercion, while === checks for strict equality (value and type).
    Example:

    console.log(5 == '5');  // true
    console.log(5 === '5'); // false

    Source: Most Asked JavaScript Interview Questions â€” Part 1

What is a callback function in JavaScript?

    Description: A callback function is a function passed as an argument to another function and is executed after some operation has been completed.
    Example:

    function fetchData(callback) {
      setTimeout(() => {
        callback('Data loaded');
      }, 1000);
    }
    fetchData((message) => {
      console.log(message);
    });

    Source: Most Asked JavaScript Interview Questions â€” Part 1

What are promises in JavaScript?

    Description: A promise is an object that represents the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value.
    Example:

    const myPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
      let success = true;
      if (success) resolve("Success");
      else reject("Failure");
    });
    myPromise.then((message) => console.log(message))
              .catch((error) => console.error(error));
