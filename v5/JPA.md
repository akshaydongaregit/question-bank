    How do you handle entity versioning and optimistic locking in JPA?
        2Ô∏è‚É£ How Does JPA Handle @Version?

        When JPA detects a versioned entity update:

            It adds WHERE version = ? to the update statement.
            If no rows are updated, it throws OptimisticLockException.

        ‚úÖ Generated SQL for Update

        UPDATE product 
        SET price = ?, version = version + 1 
        WHERE id = ? AND version = ?;

        If no row matches the WHERE condition, it means another transaction has updated the entity, causing an optimistic lock failure.

-------------- round 4 
üå± Basic Level

    What is JPA, and how does it differ from Hibernate?
        Answer: JPA (Java Persistence API) is a specification that defines a standard way to manage relational data in Java applications. Hibernate is a popular implementation of this specification, providing additional features beyond the standard.

    What is the purpose of the @Entity annotation in JPA?
        Answer: The @Entity annotation marks a Java class as an entity, indicating that it should be mapped to a table in the database.

    How do you define a primary key in a JPA entity?
        Answer: A primary key is defined using the @Id annotation on a field, and you can specify the generation strategy with the @GeneratedValue annotation.

    What is the role of the EntityManager in JPA?
        Answer: The EntityManager interface provides methods to interact with the persistence context, including operations like persisting, removing, and finding entities.

    How do you perform basic CRUD operations using JPA?
        Answer: Basic CRUD operations can be performed using methods like persist(), merge(), remove(), and find() provided by the EntityManager.

üî• Medium Level

    What are the different types of relationships in JPA, and how are they mapped?
        Answer: JPA supports relationships like One-to-One, One-to-Many, Many-to-One, and Many-to-Many, which are mapped using annotations such as @OneToOne, @OneToMany, @ManyToOne, and @ManyToMany.

    Explain the concept of cascading in JPA.
        Answer: Cascading allows operations to be propagated from a parent entity to its related entities. This is managed using the cascade attribute in relationship annotations, with types like PERSIST, MERGE, REMOVE, etc.

    What is the difference between fetch types EAGER and LAZY in JPA?
        Answer: EAGER fetching retrieves related entities immediately, while LAZY fetching delays the retrieval until the related entity is accessed.

    How do you handle transactions in JPA?
        Answer: Transactions in JPA can be managed programmatically using the EntityTransaction API or declaratively using the @Transactional annotation in frameworks like Spring.

    What is JPQL, and how does it differ from SQL?
        Answer: JPQL (Java Persistence Query Language) is an object-oriented query language defined by JPA, operating on entity objects rather than directly on database tables, unlike SQL.

üöÄ Advanced Level

    How does the @Inheritance annotation work in JPA?
        Answer: The @Inheritance annotation is used to define inheritance strategies for entity classes, with strategies like SINGLE_TABLE, JOINED, and TABLE_PER_CLASS.

    What is the purpose of the EntityManagerFactory in JPA?
        Answer: The EntityManagerFactory is responsible for creating EntityManager instances and is typically designed to be thread-safe and shared across the application.

    Explain the use of the Criteria API in JPA.
        Answer: The Criteria API allows for the creation of type-safe, dynamic queries in a programmatic way, as an alternative to using JPQL.

    How do you implement optimistic locking in JPA?
        Answer: Optimistic locking is implemented using the @Version annotation, which maintains a version field to detect concurrent modifications.

    What are entity listeners in JPA, and how are they used?
        Answer: Entity listeners are classes or methods annotated to receive callbacks on entity lifecycle events, such as @PrePersist and @PostLoad.

‚ö° Challenging Level

    How do you handle the N+1 select problem in JPA?
        Answer: The N+1 select problem can be mitigated by using fetch joins in JPQL or configuring proper fetching strategies to reduce the number of queries executed.

    What is the difference between merge() and update() in JPA?
        Answer: In JPA, merge() is used to synchronize the state of a detached entity with the persistence context, while update() is not a standard JPA method but is specific to certain implementations like Hibernate.

    How do you implement batch processing in JPA?
        Answer: Batch processing can be achieved by batching insert or update operations and periodically flushing and clearing the persistence context to manage memory usage.

    Explain the concept of secondary tables in JPA.
        Answer: Secondary tables allow an entity to map its fields to multiple tables using the @SecondaryTable annotation, enabling the splitting of entity attributes across different tables.

    How do you manage multiple persistence units in a JPA application?
        Answer: Managing multiple persistence units involves defining multiple persistence-unit elements in the persistence.xml file and creating corresponding EntityManagerFactory beans for each unit.

üß† Very Challenging Level

    How would you design a multi-tenant application using JPA?
        Answer: Designing a multi-tenant application can involve strategies like schema-based, database-based, or discriminator-based multitenancy, each requiring specific configurations and considerations in JPA.

    What are the implications of using CascadeType.REMOVE in JPA relationships?
        Answer: Using CascadeType.REMOVE propagates the remove operation to associated entities, which can lead to the deletion of related data, so it must be used cautiously to prevent unintended data loss.

    How do you handle large data sets efficiently in JPA?
        Answer: Efficient handling of large data sets can
